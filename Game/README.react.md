# AR Test Game (React)

This workspace now contains React functional components under `Game/js/react/` and a Vite-based dev setup.

Quick start (requires Node.js):

1. cd Game
2. npm install
3. npm start
4. Open http://localhost:5173/game.react.html

Files moved into `Game/`:
- `Game/css/styles.css` - styles
- `Game/js/` - legacy DOM modules
- `Game/js/react/` - React components and entry
- `Game/game.react.html` - HTML entry that mounts React app
- `Game/package.json` - minimal Vite + React dev deps

Notes:
- If you prefer to keep a single root package.json, you can instead run the dev server from the repository root.
